My sandbox to work through Cormen et. al's *Introduction to Algorithms*
=======================================================================

The primary focus of this repository will be exploration of the algorithms and 
data structures as described in CLRS, in a fast object-oriented language, 
with some thoughts sprinkled in here and there.  

So if you are expecting SingletonFactoryBeans, or indeed even unit tests, 
this isn't the place. This is an analysis sandbox, even though that isn't 
Java's normal forte.
